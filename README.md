# technoHacks-Internship

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing the tasks I completed during my internship at Technohacks.

## Task 1: Login Page

In Task 1, I built a login page for a website. This page includes:

- Input validation for secure data entry.
- Password hashing for enhanced security.
- Additionally, I implemented a "Forget Password" functionality which consists of the following steps:
  - Verification of the user's identity through OTP sent to their email.
  - Change password page for updating the password securely.
  
For sending emails, I utilized PHP mailer.

## Task 2: Currency Converter

Task 2 involved the creation of a Currency Converter app. Here's what it does:

- It allows users to convert between different currencies.
- I integrated the Open Exchange Rates API to provide accurate and up-to-date currency conversion rates.

## Task 3: Countdown Timer

In Task 3, I developed a Countdown Timer with the following features:

- It counts down from a user-set time to zero.
- It provides options to stop, reset, and restart the timer.
- I also included an "Enter Time" functionality which calculates the remaining time required to reach a specific time.
